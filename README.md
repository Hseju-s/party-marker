# party-marker


Marks party member or self. Markers are reapplied after being ressed (no matter who dies).
Marks Party members with those Yellow, Blue and Red Marks.

For everyone to see your mark, you must be the leader.

The command is:
> /proxy mark role color role color role color

Ex. 

> /proxy mark heal red dps blue tank yellow

> /proxy mark dps red heal yellow

so on so on...

You can also mark client side with following format, does not require lead 

> /proxy mark me color (other roles color) me color.

The initial me color lets it know that you only want it client side.

Ex. 

>/proxy mark me red heal yellow tank red me blue

This will mark healers yellow, tank red and you blue. Will disregard the first color of me.
